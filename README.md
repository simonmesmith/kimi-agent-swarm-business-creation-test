# Can Kimi Agent Swarm Create a Business?

This repository contains outputs from Kimi Agent Swarm's attempts to create a business, which I wrote about on X.

Note that while most of the output files were completed in a single Agent Swarm execution, I did have to prompt for a fix to the investor presentation as it had a bug in the code that prevented it from rendering properly.

## The Prompt

Build a market-ready, profitable Consumer Health company from scratch. Deploy specialized agents to execute the following phases.

### Phase 1: Market Intelligence & Gap Analysis

* **Action:** Scour social media (Reddit, X, TikTok trends), medical publications (PubMed, NIH), and consumer reviews. Approach the problem with different perspectives to ensure we're trying different ways of finding an unmet need.
* **Goal:** Identify a high-growth "unmet need" in consumer health.
* **Constraint:** The solution must be a **physical product** (consumable or hardware) using only **GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe)** ingredients or pre-approved electronic components (Class I medical devices or general wellness tech). No high-barrier FDA clinical trial paths.
* **Deliverable:** A Market Opportunity Report identifying the niche and the "Why Now."

### Phase 2: Product R&D & Business Modeling

* **Action:** Brainstorm 5 product solutions for the identified niche. Evaluate based on: 1) Manufacturing feasibility, 2) Scalability, and 3) Profit margins.
* **Operations:** Identify specific raw material suppliers or OEM manufacturers. Calculate COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), MSRP, and customer acquisition cost (CAC) estimates.
* **Deliverable:** A rigorous Business Case and a 3-year Financial Proforma (including the "Year to Profitability" milestone).

### Phase 3: Brand Identity & Digital Presence

* **Action:** Generate a brand name with an **available .com domain**.
* **Creative:** Design a high-fidelity logo, a landing page wireframe/copy, and a suite of visual assets (3 banner ads and a Google Ads keyword/copy spreadsheet).
* **Constraint:** Use the "Technical Magic" approach—explain the science clearly but compellingly.

### Phase 4: The Investor "Gauntlet"

* **Action:** Synthesize all data into a **Guy Kawasaki 10/20/30 Pitch Deck** (10 slides, 20 minutes, 30pt font style).
* **Simulation:** Simulate diverse investors and pitching to them. Present the deck, ingest their brutal feedback, and iterate the Business Plan and Pitch Deck until a "Consensus Buy-In" is reached.

### Phase 5: Consumer Validation & Final Polish

* **Action:** Simulate customer personas representing the target niche. Present the brand name, messaging, and website copy.
* **Iterate:** Refine all deliverables based on simulated customer feedback.

### Final Deliverables Required:

1. **Executive Business Plan** (Research-backed).
2. **Investor Pitch Deck** (Kawasaki Style).
3. **Brand Identity Kit** (Name, Logo, Domain status).
4. **Marketing and Sales Engine** (Website, Banner ads, Paid Search Spreadsheet).
5. **Supply Chain Map** (Identified suppliers and component costs).
