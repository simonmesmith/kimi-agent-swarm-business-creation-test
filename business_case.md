### Recommendation Summary

**Mindrest (Solution 2)** is the optimal choice because:

1. **Best Balance**: Optimal combination of margin (65-70%), differentiation, and manageable complexity
2. **Strongest Positioning**: "Wake up sharp" directly addresses dual benefit (sleep + cognitive)
3. **Most Scalable**: Capsule format with established supply chain; can scale to 1M+ units
4. **Optimal Risk/Reward**: Lower regulatory risk, more CMO options, 24-36 month shelf life
5. **Competitive Moat**: Time-release Magtein is novel; patent opportunity exists

---

## CONCLUSION

Mindrest represents a compelling investment opportunity in the rapidly growing sleep-cognitive supplement market. With:

- **Strong market timing**: Prevagen FTC loss, melatonin backlash, sleep crisis
- **First-mover advantage**: No competitor offers time-release Magtein
- **Excellent unit economics**: 4.35x LTV:CAC, 2-month payback
- **Clear path to profitability**: Breakeven in Q2 Year 2
- **Scalable model**: DTC-first with retail expansion potential

The recommended funding of $750,000-900,000 provides 18-24 months of runway to achieve product-market fit and profitability, positioning the company for a successful Series A or strategic exit.

**Investment Recommendation: PROCEED**
