## SLIDE 1: TITLE
**"Sleep Deep. Wake Sharp."**

### Key Message
Introduce REMAGNESIO as the breakthrough supplement that solves the sleep-cognition paradox.

### What to Say (30 seconds)
"Good morning. I'm [Name], founder of REMAGNESIO. We're building the first supplement that delivers both deep, restorative sleep AND enhanced cognitive performance—without the grogginess of melatonin or the jitters of caffeine. Our tagline says it all: Sleep Deep. Wake Sharp."

### Key Points to Emphasize
- First-mover advantage in time-release Magtein
- Dual benefit: sleep + cognition in one product
- Premium positioning in $4.2B market

### Transition
"But before I tell you how we do this, let me show you the massive problem we're solving..."

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
**70M Americans | $411B Cost | $4.2B Market**

### Key Message
Sleep is a massive, expensive problem with no good solutions currently available.

### What to Say (60 seconds)
"Seventy million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. The economic cost? Four hundred eleven billion dollars annually in lost productivity, accidents, and healthcare. The addressable market for sleep and cognitive supplements combined is $4.2 billion and growing.

But here's the real pain point: Current solutions force consumers to choose. Sleep aids like melatonin leave you groggy. Cognitive enhancers keep you awake. There's nothing that does both—until now."

### Key Statistics to Reference
- 70M Americans with sleep problems (CDC data)
- $411B annual economic impact (RAND Corporation study)
- $4.2B addressable market (sleep + cognitive intersection)

### Transition
"So how do we solve this paradox? Let me show you our solution..."

## SLIDE 3: OUR SOLUTION
**REMAGNESIO: Time-Release Formula**

### Key Message
REMAGNESIO is the only supplement that delivers both sleep and cognitive benefits through proprietary time-release technology.

### What to Say (60 seconds)
"REMAGNESIO is the first time-release Magnesium L-Threonate supplement. It works in two phases: First, it helps you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer—naturally, without hormones. Second, it enhances focus, memory, and mental clarity the next day.

The magic is in our time-release delivery. Unlike standard magnesium that passes through your system in hours, our formula maintains optimal brain magnesium levels throughout the night and into the next day."

### Key Benefits to Highlight
1. **Sleep Deep** - Fall asleep faster, stay asleep
2. **Wake Sharp** - Enhanced focus & clarity
3. **No Grogginess** - Melatonin-free, non-habit forming
4. **Brain Health** - Crosses blood-brain barrier

### Transition
"Now let me show you how we make money..."

## SLIDE 4: BUSINESS MODEL
**Subscription-Driven with Strong Unit Economics**

### Key Message
Profitable unit economics with a subscription model that maximizes customer lifetime value.

### What to Say (60 seconds)
"We price at $49.99 for a one-month supply, with a 15% discount for subscribers at $42.49. Our cost of goods is $21.12, giving us a healthy 39% gross margin.

But here's what excites investors: Our unit economics are exceptional. Customer lifetime value is $176 against a customer acquisition cost of just $40.65. That's a 4.35x LTV to CAC ratio with an 8-month payback period. These are best-in-class metrics for the supplement industry."

### Key Metrics to Emphasize
| Metric | Value | Benchmark |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| LTV | $176 | $100-150 |
| CAC | $40.65 | $50-80 |
| LTV:CAC | 4.35x | 3x+ is good |
| Payback | 8 months | 12-18 months |

### Transition
"But what makes our product truly defensible? Let me show you the underlying magic..."

## SLIDE 5: UNDERLYING MAGIC
**Science-Backed Innovation**

### Key Message
REMAGNESIO is built on breakthrough science with proven cognitive benefits.

### What to Say (90 seconds)
"The underlying magic is Magnesium L-Threonate, or Magtein—a patented compound developed by MIT scientists. Unlike standard magnesium supplements that have only 4% brain bioavailability, Magtein achieves 85% bioavailability because it's specifically designed to cross the blood-brain barrier.

MIT research showed that Magtein can reduce brain age by 7.5 years. It works by increasing brain magnesium levels, which enhances synaptic plasticity—the foundation of learning and memory.

Our innovation is the time-release delivery system. We've partnered with leading CMOs to create a proprietary formulation that releases Magtein gradually throughout the night. This means sustained benefits for both sleep quality and next-day cognitive performance."

### Science Points to Reference
- 7.5-year brain age reduction (MIT study)
- 85% bioavailability vs. 4% standard magnesium
- Crosses blood-brain barrier (unique to Magtein)
- GABA activation for natural sleep support

### Transition
"Now, how do we get this product into customers' hands?"

## SLIDE 6: GO-TO-MARKET
**Multi-Channel Strategy Targeting Stressed Professionals**

### Key Message
Data-driven marketing targeting high-value customers through proven channels.

### What to Say (60 seconds)
"Our go-to-market strategy focuses on stressed professionals aged 30-50 with household income over $75,000. These are people who value performance, have disposable income, and are actively searching for solutions.

We start with digital advertising on Meta and Google, targeting high-intent keywords like 'sleep supplements' and 'brain fog solutions.' We layer in influencer partnerships with health and wellness creators, biohackers, and sleep experts who can authentically endorse our product.

Content marketing builds trust through sleep science education. And in Year 2, we'll expand into premium retail channels like Whole Foods and Erewhon to capture the in-person supplement market."

### Channel Strategy
1. **Digital Ads** - Meta, Google, TikTok (primary)
2. **Influencer** - Health, wellness, biohacking creators
3. **Content** - Email, blog, sleep science education
4. **Retail** - Year 2: Whole Foods, Erewhon

### Transition
"But what about competition? Let me address the elephant in the room..."

---

## SLIDE 7: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
**No Direct Competitor Exists**

### Key Message
REMAGNESIO has a unique position with no direct competition in the time-release Magtein space.

### What to Say (60 seconds)
"The competitive landscape has opened up significantly. Prevagen, a major player in the cognitive supplement space, just lost an FTC case in December 2024 for false advertising claims. That's opened a $100 million plus market opportunity.

Melatonin products dominate sleep aids, but the American Academy of Sleep Medicine now warns against chronic use due to hormone disruption and morning grogginess. Standard magnesium supplements have poor brain bioavailability—only 4%—and cause digestive side effects.

No competitor offers time-release Magtein. We're the first to combine the proven science of Magtein with innovative delivery technology to solve both sleep and cognition in one product."

### Competitive Advantage Summary
| Competitor | Weakness | Our Advantage |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| Melatonin | Hormone disruption, grogginess | Natural, non-hormonal |
| Prevagen | FTC case, false claims | Science-backed, legitimate |
| Standard Mg | 4% bioavailability, GI issues | 85% bioavailability |
| **REMAGNESIO** | **NONE** | **First time-release Magtein** |

### Transition
"A great opportunity needs a great team to execute. Let me introduce ours..."

## SLIDE 10: THE ASK
**$750K Seed Round**

### Key Message
$750K seed funding to launch, achieve product-market fit, and reach profitability.

### What to Say (60 seconds)
"We're raising $750,000 in seed funding. This capital will get us to product launch, achieve product-market fit with 10,000 customers, and reach breakeven within 18 months.

Specifically, the funds will be used for: initial inventory and manufacturing setup, digital marketing to acquire our first customers, and team expansion to support growth.

Our milestones are clear: Product launch within 6 months, 10,000 customers by month 12, and breakeven by month 18. At that point, we'll be positioned for a Series A to scale nationally.

We're looking for strategic partners who understand the supplement space and can help us build a category-defining brand. Thank you, and I'd be happy to answer any questions."

## APPENDIX: ANTICIPATED Q&A

### Q: Why will customers choose you over established brands?
**A:** We're the only product that solves both sleep and cognition without trade-offs. Established brands focus on one or the other. Plus, Prevagen's FTC loss has created distrust in the cognitive supplement space—we're entering with legitimate science.

### Q: What's stopping competitors from copying you?
**A:** Three moats: (1) First-mover advantage in time-release Magtein, (2) Customer relationships and brand trust, (3) Our CMO partnerships and formulation expertise. While competitors could eventually enter, we'll have 12-18 months of lead time to establish market position.

### Q: How do you know the unit economics will hold?
**A:** Our CAC estimates are based on current Meta/Google CPC data for supplement keywords. Our LTV is conservative—assuming only 6-month average customer lifetime. Industry benchmarks for subscription supplements show 8-12 month lifetimes, so we have upside.

### Q: What are the biggest risks?
**A:** (1) Supply chain—mitigated by identifying 3 CMOs, (2) Customer acquisition costs rising—we have multiple channel diversification, (3) Regulatory—Magtein is GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) with no regulatory concerns.

### Q: Why $750K? Why not more or less?
**A:** $750K is the minimum to reach breakeven without additional dilution. Less wouldn't get us to profitability. More would mean unnecessary dilution at this stage—we'd rather raise a larger Series A at a higher valuation once we've proven product-market fit.
